# PCInventory

These scripts will get the windowshelp user credentials for the local pc, then use those to run the GetInventory script with different credentials.  The GetInventory script will then call the ConvertCSV script to take the csv that has been created and add it to an existing excel workbook.  The GetInventory script will then remove the csv file.
